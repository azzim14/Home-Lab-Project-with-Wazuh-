# Home-Lab-Project-with-Wazuh-


## Objective

Once Ubuntu was configured, I installed the Wazuh Indexer, Wazuh Server, and Wazuh Dashboard directly from the root terminal. After installation, I backed up the internal user credentials (username & password) and accessed the Wazuh Web Interface using the server’s IP address.

From the dashboard, I successfully deployed agents to my Windows 11 machine and my MacBook Pro IOS, completing my initial endpoint onboarding.

To gain real hands-on SOC experience, I enabled File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on my Windows endpoint. I created and modified a test file and seeing the event populate instantly on the Wazuh dashboard was a big moment for me. It confirmed that my lab was working exactly as intended.

### Skills Learned
- Threat detection, FIM (File Intergrity Monitoring), Endpoint monitoring, and SOC tools in real time
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Ubuntu  Machine
- Windows OS
- Macbook OS
- Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
